## Message
Hi there! This is Robert James Nahial from LostLink devs. We would like to express our thanks 
for navigating through our website. I will be sharing some pointers so that your experience in navigating our website
would be as easy as possible.


## Login Authentication Main PHP files
The system's main authentication pages are composed by these following php files:
- Login Page (login.php)
- Signup Page (signup.php)
- Forgot Password (forgotpassword.php)
- Submit Verification Code for Changing Passwords (send_code.php)
- Reset Password (reset_password.php)
- Google Oauth2 Login (/googleAuth/google-callback.php and google-login.php)


## Transaction Frontend Main PHP files
The system's main pages (where the transactions are being done) are composed by these following php files:
- Dashboard Page (index.php)
- View Items Page (view.php)
- View Reunited Items (archives.php)
- Report an Item (report.php)
- Publish (publish.php)
- Settings (settings.php)
- Logout (logout.php -- Validation process)


## Notice:
All of the files that are somewhat named near to the main php files are most likely play a role in enabling
styling, validation, and error handling (which is very crucial for the web system).

## How to install:
We, the Team Elpis, has attached a manual document along with this repository. Please try to follow the instruction for
an easy access. If you have any concerns, please don't hesitate to contact the owner of the repository :3. Fairly-well!
